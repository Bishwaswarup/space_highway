Phase 5 Summary
===============

What we implemented
- LaTeX thesis scaffold with a dedicated Error Budget and Numerical Stability section.
- Polished results notebook to regenerate all figures and key outputs.
- Clean README with reproducible run pipeline and plotting commands.

Key files
- `report/main.tex`
- `notebooks/results.ipynb`
